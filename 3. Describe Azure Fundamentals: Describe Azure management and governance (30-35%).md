## Describe cost management in Azure<a name="cost-management"></a>

*Objectives*:

- Describe factors that can affect costs in Azure.
- Compare the Pricing calculator and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator.
- Describe the Microsoft Cost Management Tool.
- Describe the purpose of tags.

Azure costs are OpEx based. It can be impacted by many **cost factor**s. Some of the impacting factors are: resource type, consumption, geography, location, subscription type. The type of resources, the settings for the resource, and the Azure region will all have an impact on how much a resource costs. When you provision an Azure resource, Azure creates metered instances for that resource. The meters track the resources' usage and generate a usage record that is used to calculate your bill. Example: With a storage account, you specify a type such as blob, a performance tier, an access tier, redundancy settings, and a region. Creating the same storage account in different regions may show different costs and changing any of the settings may also impact the price. Different SKUs of the Resource Type, e.g.: Load Balancer: Basic and Standard, e.g.: there are different tiers for storage: hot, cold, archive etc.

The pricing calculator and the total cost of ownership (TCO) calculator are two calculators that help you understand potential Azure expenses. Both calculators are accessible from the internet, and both calculators allow you to build out a configuration. The Pricing calculator is for information purposes only. The prices are only an estimate. With the pricing calculator, you can estimate the cost of any provisioned resources, including compute, storage, and associated network costs. 

**The pricing calculator** is designed to give you an estimated cost for provisioning resources in Azure. You can get an estimate for individual resources, build out a solution, or use an example scenario to see an estimate of the Azure spend. The pricing calculatorâ€™s focus is on the cost of provisioned resources in Azure. Example: if I want basic web application I could have structure with 2 VMs, central Load Balancer, application connects to a SQL Server database that holds information. I would use: Azure VMs, Azure Application Gateway, Azure SQL Database.

**The TCO (Total Cost Ownership) calculator** is designed to help you compare the costs for running an on-premises infrastructure compared to an Azure Cloud infrastructure. With the TCO calculator, you enter your current infrastructure configuration, including servers, databases, storage, and outbound network traffic. The TCO calculator then compares the anticipated costs for your current environment with an Azure environment supporting the same infrastructure requirements. Esentially, it is being used to compare on-premises costs vs Azure costs.

**Cost Management** provides the ability to quickly check Azure resource costs, create alerts based on resource spend, and create budgets that can be used to automate management of resources.Cost Management is a service that helps avoid accidentally provisioning new resources. Cost analysis is a subset of Cost Management that provides a quick visual for your Azure costs. You can filter it by location, resource groups etc. You can set cost alerts: budget alerts, credit alerts, department spending quota alerts.

**A budget** is where you set a spending limit for Azure. You can set budgets based on a subscription, resource group, service type, or other criteria. When you set a budget, you will also set a budget alert. Alert conditions can be actual (e.g.: 50% of actual use of 300$ budget) or forecasted (based on trend).

**Tags** are way to organize resources. Tags are just key-value pairs. They are not being inherited. ags provide extra information, or metadata, about your resources. This metadata is useful for: resource management, cost management and optimization, operations management, security, governance, regulatory compliance, workload optimization and automation. You can add, modify, or delete resource tags through Windows PowerShell, the Azure CLI, Azure Resource Manager templates, the REST API, or the Azure portal. Example: Tag: Impact - only mission-critical resources.
