## Describe cost management in Azure<a name="cost-management"></a>

*Objectives*:

- Describe factors that can affect costs in Azure.
- Compare the Pricing calculator and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator.
- Describe the Microsoft Cost Management Tool.
- Describe the purpose of tags.

**CONCEPTS AND KEYWORDS:** *Pricing calculator, Total cost of ownership (TCO), Cost Management, Alerts, Budget, Tags*

Azure costs are OpEx based. It can be impacted by many **cost factors**. Some of the impacting factors are: resource type, consumption, geography, location, subscription type. The type of resources, the settings for the resource, and the Azure region will all have an impact on how much a resource costs. When you provision an Azure resource, Azure creates metered instances for that resource. The meters track the resources usage and generate a usage record that is used to calculate your bill. Example: With a storage account, you specify a type such as blob, a performance tier, an access tier, redundancy settings, and a region. Creating the same storage account in different regions may show different costs and changing any of the settings may also impact the price. Different SKUs of the Resource Type, e.g.: Load Balancer: Basic and Standard, e.g.: there are different tiers for storage: hot, cold, archive etc.

The pricing calculator and the total cost of ownership (TCO) calculator are two calculators that help you understand potential Azure expenses. Both calculators are accessible from the internet, and both calculators allow you to build out a configuration. The Pricing calculator is for information purposes only. The prices are only an estimate. With the pricing calculator, you can estimate the cost of any provisioned resources, including compute, storage, and associated network costs. 

**The pricing calculator** is designed to give you an estimated cost for provisioning resources in Azure. You can get an estimate for individual resources, build out a solution, or use an example scenario to see an estimate of the Azure spend. The pricing calculator’s focus is on the cost of provisioned resources in Azure. Example: if I want basic web application I could have structure with 2 VMs, central Load Balancer, application connects to a SQL Server database that holds information. I would use: Azure VMs, Azure Application Gateway, Azure SQL Database.

**The TCO (Total Cost Ownership) calculator** is designed to help you compare the costs for running an on-premises infrastructure compared to an Azure Cloud infrastructure. With the TCO calculator, you enter your current infrastructure configuration, including servers, databases, storage, and outbound network traffic. The TCO calculator then compares the anticipated costs for your current environment with an Azure environment supporting the same infrastructure requirements. Esentially, it is being used to compare on-premises costs vs Azure costs.

**Cost Management** provides the ability to quickly check Azure resource costs, create alerts based on resource spend, and create budgets that can be used to automate management of resources. Cost Management is a service that helps avoid accidentally provisioning new resources. Cost analysis is a subset of Cost Management that provides a quick visual for your Azure costs. You can filter it by location, resource groups etc. You can set cost alerts: budget alerts, credit alerts, department spending quota alerts.

**A budget** is where you set a spending limit for Azure. You can set budgets based on a subscription, resource group, service type, or other criteria. When you set a budget, you will also set a budget alert. Alert conditions can be actual (e.g.: 50% of actual use of 300$ budget) or forecasted (based on trend).

**Tags** are way to organize resources. Tags are just key-value pairs. They are not being inherited. Tags provide extra information, or metadata, about your resources. This metadata is useful for: resource management, cost management and optimization, operations management, security, governance, regulatory compliance, workload optimization and automation. You can add, modify, or delete resource tags through Windows PowerShell, the Azure CLI, Azure Resource Manager templates, the REST API, or the Azure portal. Example: Tag: Impact - only mission-critical resources.

## Describe features and tools in Azure for governance and compliance<a name="feature-tools-governance"></a>

*Objectives*:

- Describe the purpose of Microsoft Purview
- Describe the purpose of Azure Policy
- Describe the purpose of resource locks
- Describe the purpose of the Service Trust portal

**CONCEPTS AND KEYWORDS:** *Microsoft Purview, Azure Policy, Azure Policy initiative, Resource locks, Types of locks, Microsoft Service Trust Portal*

**Microsoft Purview** provides a unified data governance solution to help manage and govern your on-premises, multicloud, and software as a service (SaaS) data. Microsoft Purview is built on the previous Azure Purview and Microsot365 Azure Compliance Solutions. It's about Unified Data Governance.
Microsoft Purview is focused on the idea that we want to understand where is the data, in which state is the data, how important is it etc. Govern, protect, and manage all your data with Microsoft Purview, comprehensive solutions to help give you better visibility and control. Two versions of Microsoft Purview: Free and Enterprise with different set of cabalities (clasify the data, labels, insights...).

**Azure Policy** is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit your resources. These policies enforce different rules across your resource configurations so that those configurations stay compliant with corporate standards. With Azure Policy you ensure that your resources stay compliant, you can get alerts if resource configuration has changed. Example: company have regulatory, security requirements: data can be in only some regions. Azure Policies can be set at each level, enabling you to set policies on a specific resource, resource group, subscription, management group. Additionally, Azure Policies are inherited, so if you set a policy at a high level, it will automatically be applied to all of the groupings that fall within the parent. For example, if you set an Azure Policy on a resource group, all resources created within that resource group will automatically receive the same policy.

Azure Policy enables you to define both individual policies and groups of related policies, known as **initiatives**. For example, Azure Policy includes an initiative named Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center. Its goal is to monitor all available security recommendations for all Azure resource types in Azure Security Center.

Each policy definition in Azure Policy has a single effect. That effect determines what happens when the policy rule is evaluated to match. The effects behave differently if they are for a new resource, an updated resource, or an existing resource. These effects are currently supported in a policy definition: AddToNetworkGroup, Append, Audit, AuditIfNotExists, Deny, DenyAction, DeployIfNotExists, Disabled, Manual, Modify, Mutate.

**A resource lock** prevents resources from being accidentally deleted or changed. Even with Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) policies in place, there's still a risk that people with the right level of access could delete critical cloud resources. Resource locks prevent resources from being deleted or updated, depending on the type of lock. Resource locks can be applied to individual resources, resource groups, or even an entire subscription. Resource locks are inherited down, meaning that if you place a resource lock on a resource group, all of the resources within the resource group will also have the resource lock applied. You can manage resource locks from the Azure portal, PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or from an Azure Resource Manager template.

Resource lock 2 types: 
1.	DELETE – means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource.
2.	READ ONLY - means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource. 

ARM is control plane for interaction with objects. Resource Lock is being applied at ARM level. Data plane is not affected: for example: database. You can still interact with database.

To modify a locked resource, you must first remove the lock. After you remove the lock, you can apply any action you have permissions to perform. Resource locks apply regardless of RBAC permissions. Even if you're an owner of the resource, you must still remove the lock before you can perform the blocked activity. Point of this is additional step of control.

**The Microsoft Service Trust Portal** is a portal that provides access to various content, tools, and other resources about Microsoft security, privacy, and compliance practices. The Service Trust Portal contains details about Microsoft's implementation of controls and processes that protect our cloud services and the customer data therein. To access some of the resources on the Service Trust Portal, you must sign in as an authenticated user with your Microsoft cloud services account (Microsoft Entra organization account). You'll need to review and accept the Microsoft non-disclosure agreement for compliance materials.

## Describe features and tools for managing and deploying Azure resources<a name="feature-tools-managing-deploying"></a>

*Objectives*:

- Describe Azure portal
- Describe Azure Cloud Shell, including Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell
- Describe the purpose of Azure Arc
- Describe Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and Azure ARM templates

**CONCEPTS AND KEYWORDS:** *Azure Portal, Azure Cloud Shell, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, AzureArc, Infrastructure as code, Azure Resource Manager, ARM templates, Bicep*

**The Azure portal** is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools. With the Azure portal, you can manage your Azure subscription by using a graphical user interface. You can: build, manage, monitor everything, create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources, configure accessibility options for optimal experience.

**Azure Cloud Shell** is a browser-based shell tool that allows you to create, configure, and manage Azure resources using a shell. Azure Cloud Shell support both Azure PowerShell and the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI), which is a Bash shell. You can access Azure Cloud Shell via the Azure portal by selecting the Cloud Shell icon. Azure Cloud Shell has several features that make it a unique: browser-based shell experience, with no local installation required, it is authenticated to your Azure credentials, so when you log in it inherently knows who you are and what permissions you have, you choose the shell you’re most familiar with; Azure Cloud Shell supports both Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI (which uses Bash).

**Azure PowerShell** is a shell with which developers, DevOps, and IT professionals can run commands called command-lets (cmdlets). These commands call the Azure REST API to perform management tasks in Azure. Cmdlets can be run independently to handle one-off changes, or they may be combined to help orchestrate complex actions such as: the routine setup, teardown, and maintenance of a single resource or multiple connected resources, the deployment of an entire infrastructure, which might contain dozens or hundreds of resources, from imperative code.
Capturing the commands in a script makes the process repeatable and automatable.

**The Azure CLI** is functionally equivalent to Azure PowerShell, with the primary difference being the syntax of commands. While Azure PowerShell uses PowerShell commands, the Azure CLI uses Bash commands. The Azure CLI provides the same benefits of handling discrete tasks or orchestrating complex operations through code. It’s also installable on Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms, as well as through Azure Cloud Shell. Due to the similarities in capabilities and access between Azure PowerShell and the Bash based Azure CLI, it mainly comes down to which language you’re most familiar with. 

Linux and Unix systems mostly use Bash. CMD is the command line for Microsoft Windows operating system, with command-based features. Powershell is a task-based command-line interface, specifically designed for system admins and is based on the .NET Framework. Bash is a command-line and scripting language for most Unix/Linux-based operating systems.

**Azure Arc** provides a centralized, unified way to: Manage your entire environment together by projecting your existing non-Azure and/or on-premises resources into Azure Resource Manager. Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform. Azure Arc can be a bridge that extends the Azure platform. In utilizing Azure Resource Manager (ARM), Azure Arc lets you extend your Azure compliance and monitoring to your hybrid and multi-cloud configurations. Currently, Azure Arc allows you to manage the following resource types hosted outside of Azure: servers, Kubernetes clusters, Azure data services, SQL Server, Virtual machines (preview).

**Azure Resource Manager (ARM)** is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account. Anytime you do anything with your Azure resources, ARM is involved. Everything that we are going to do is going through Azure Resource Manager. It doesn’t matter is it through portal, CLI, API etc. With Azure Resource Manager, you can: manage your infrastructure thorugh declarative templates. A Resource Manager template is a JSON file that defines what you want to deploy to Azure, apply access control to all services because RBAC is natively integrated into the management platform, apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.

**Infrastructure as code** is a concept where you manage your infrastructure as lines of code. **ARM templates** and **Bicep** are two examples of using infrastructure as code with the Azure Resource Manager to maintain your environment. Best way to provision resources are via ARM templates. ARM templates are using JSON as format and it is declarative. By using ARM templates, you can describe the resources you want to use in a declarative JSON format. With an ARM template, the deployment code is verified before any code is run. This ensures that the resources will be created and connected correctly. Bicep is a language that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. A Bicep file defines the infrastructure and configuration. Then, ARM deploys that environment based on your Bicep file. While similar to an ARM template, which is written in JSON, Bicep files tend to use a simpler, more concise style.

If I want to provision something I want to use ARM templates. I can have these files in my Git Repos and then call them as part of my CI/CD pipelines. Bicep is a different format – human friendly. Same declarative format. It converts to ARM template behind the scenes.

## Describe monitoring tools in Azure<a name="monitoring-tools"></a>

*Objectives*:

- Describe the purpose of Azure Advisor
- Describe Azure Service Health
- Describe Azure Monitor, including Azure Log Analytics, Azure Monitor Alerts, and Application Insights

**CONCEPTS AND KEYWORDS:** *Azure Advisor, Azure Service Health, Azure Monitor, Azure Log Analytics, Azure Monitor Alerts, Application Insights*

**Azure Advisor** evaluates your Azure resources and makes recommendations to help improve reliability, security, and performance, achieve operational excellence, and reduce costs. Azure Advisor is designed to help you save time on cloud optimization. It gives you nice reccomendations around many different things and one of those things is Cost Optimization. It can be accessed through Portal or through the API. The recommendations are divided into five categories: reliability, security, performance, operational excellence, cost.

**Azure Service Health** helps you keep track of Azure resource, both your specifically deployed resources and the overall status of Azure. We can create Health Alerts. Azure service health does this by combining three different Azure services: 

- Azure Status is a broad picture of the status of Azure globally. 
- Service Health provides a narrower view of Azure services and regions. It focuses on the Azure services and regions you're using.
- Resource Health is a tailored view of your actual Azure resources. It provides information about the health of your individual cloud resources, such as a specific virtual machine instance. Using Azure Monitor, you can also configure alerts to notify you of availability changes to your cloud resources.

**Azure Monitor** is a platform for collecting data on your resources, analyzing that data, visualizing the information, and even acting on the results. Azure Monitor can monitor Azure resources, your on-premises resources, and even multi-cloud resources like virtual machines hosted with a different cloud provider. Microsoft combined three unique services: Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights under the umbrella of Azure Monitor to provide powerful end-to-end monitoring of your applications and the components they rely on. 

**Azure Monitor Alerts**  are an automated way to stay informed when Azure Monitor detects a threshold being crossed. You set the alert conditions, the notification actions, and then Azure Monitor Alerts notifies when an alert is triggered. Depending on your configuration, Azure Monitor Alerts can also attempt corrective action.

**Azure Log Analytics** is the tool in the Azure portal where you’ll write and run log queries on the data gathered by Azure Monitor. Log Analytics is a robust tool that supports both simple, complex queries, and data analysis. 

**Application Insights** is an Azure Monitor feature that monitors your web applications. Application Insights is capable of monitoring applications that are running in Azure, on-premises, or in a different cloud environment. There are two ways to configure Application Insights to help monitor your application. You can either install an SDK in your application, or you can use the Application Insights agent. The Application Insights agent is supported in C#.NET, VB.NET, Java, JavaScript, Node.js, and Python. Not only does Application Insights help you monitor the performance of your application, but you can also configure it to periodically send synthetic requests to your application, allowing you to check the status and monitor your application even during periods of low activity.
