**CONCEPTS AND KEYWORDS:** *Core architectural components: 1. Physical Infrastructure (Azure Global Infrastructure, Datacenters, Geography, Availability Zones, Regions, Region Pairs, Sovereign Regions) 2. Management Infrastructure (Azure resources, Resource Groups, Azure Resource Manager, Declarative Syntax, ARM templates, Bicep files, Subscriptions, Accounts, Management Groups), Azure Arc, ways to interact with Azure environment ...*

**Physical infrastructure**:

Physical infrastructure starts with datacenters. Datacenters are grouped into regions. **Region** is a geographical area on the plate that contains at least one datacenter that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network (2ms round trip latency envelop). We are using public cloud so we are using public regions but there are **sovereign regions** e.g.: AzureUSGovernment, China East. With these clouds data sovereignity or regulatory requirements can be met. Region pairing is the relationship between two Azure regions within the same geographic area to provide geographically redundant solutions. Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography and same regulatory boundaries (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away => **Region Pairs**. Some services have built in replication to another regions and regions are actually paired, e.g.: Azure Storage if Geo-redundant data is picked is being replicated to paired region. 

**Availability zones** are logically and physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks. Not all Azure Regions currently support availability zones. The point of availability zone is that we will get resiliency in terms of separate phsyical location/building with independent power, cooling, network. Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers and databases.

**Management infrastructure**:

Hierarchy is: Tenant -> Subscription -> Resource Group -> Resource (e.g. a VM). The **Azure AD tenant (Microsoft Entra)** provides a single place to manage users, groups and their permissions for the applications published in the Azure AD.  A tenant is an Azure Active Directory that contains users and is the basis for security. A tenant is free. Accounts that we have for Azure must live somewhere. They are living in Azure AD tenants. In tenant there are users, groups etc. Every subscription trusts one and only one Azure AD Tenant. **Azure Subscription** is base unit of an agreement between a customer and Microsoft and it is needed to use and run Azure services. Services are either license based (e.g. Azure AD P1 or M365 E5) or usage based (SQL Server, VM, or storage). License based are attached to the tenant, usage based are attached to a subscription, which is a billing vehicle. This can be an Enterprise Agreement (billed by Microsoft), Cloud Solution Provider (billed by a partner), or Pay as You Go (billed by Microsoft on a credit card). You can have any number of subscriptions on a tenant. A **resource** is the basic building block of Azure. It is a manageable item. Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource. Virtual Machines (VMs), virtual networks, databases, cognitive services, etc. are all considered resources within Azure. All resources live in resource groups. **Resource Groups** are simply groupings of resources. When resource is created you are required to place it into resource group. Single resource can be in only one resource group at a time. Resource group can't be nested. Resources are gathered into resource groups, and resource groups are gathered into subscriptions. If you have many subscriptions, you might need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. **Azure management groups** provide a level of scope above subscriptions. If we have multiple subscriptions, for example 4,5 subscriptions then management groups are useful. At management group we can apply RBAC, budget, policy. They are inherited down in hierarchy. Point of management groups is to help manage a group of subscriptions. Usage: create a hierarchy that applies a policy, provide user access to multiple subscriptions etc. Facts: 10.000 management groups is maximum in a single directory, management group tree can support up to six levels of depth.

## Describe Azure compute and networking services <a name="compute-and-networking-services"></a>

*Objectives*: 

- Compare compute types, including container instances, virtual machines, and functions.
- Describe virtual machine options, including virtual machines (VMs), virtual machine scale sets, virtual machine availability sets, and Azure Virtual Desktop.
- Describe resources required for virtual machines.
- Describe application hosting options, including Azure Web Apps, containers, and virtual machines.
- Describe virtual networking, including the purpose of Azure Virtual Networks, Azure virtual subnets, peering, Azure DNS, VPN Gateway, and ExpressRoute.
- Define public and private endpoints.

**CONCEPTS AND KEYWORDS:** *Virtual machines, Virtual machine scale sets, Virtual machine availablity sets, Azure Virtual Desktop, containers, Azure containers, VMs vs containers, Azure container apps, Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS), Azure Functions, Azure App Service, Azure virtual networks, Routing and Filtering Network Traffic, Configure Network Access - network rules,  Azure VPN, VPN Gateways, High-availability VPN scenarios, Azure ExpressRoute, Azure DNS.*

An **Azure virtual machine** is an on-demand, scalable computer resource that is available in Azure. With Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), you can create and use VMs in the cloud. VMs provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS) in the form of a virtualized server. Just like a physical computer, you can customize all of the software running on your VM. VMs are ideal if you need: total control over the operating system, the ability to run custom software, use custom hosting configurations. Virtual machine is a resource that needs to be in resource group. There are several resources required for virtual machines: OS - operating system managed disk, one or more optional data disks to separate data from disks, virtual network with subnets: Virtual NIC, as part of NIC optionally there are IP configurations e.g.: Public IP etc. Another type of virtual machine is the **Azure Virtual Desktop**. Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud. It enables you to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location.

**Virtual machine scale sets** let you create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs. If I need multiple instances but don’t want to manually create everyhting. If I want to scale multiple identical virtual machines. **Virtual machine availability** sets are designed to ensure that VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, preventing you from losing all your VMs with a single network or power failure. Availability sets do this by grouping VMs in two ways: update domain and fault domain.

While virtual machines are an excellent way to reduce costs versus the investments that are necessary for physical hardware, they're still limited to a single operating system per virtual machine. If you want to run multiple instances of an application on a single host machine, containers are an excellent choice. Containers are a virtualization environment. Much like running multiple virtual machines on a single physical host, you can run multiple containers on a single physical or virtual host. Unlike virtual machines, you don't manage the operating system for a container. **Azure Container Instances** are fastest and simplest way to run container in Azure. You can get your own VM, install container runtime etc. but there is Azure Container Instances that is doing all of that for us. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** is a container orchestration service. An orchestration service manages the lifecycle of containers. When you're deploying a fleet of containers, AKS can make fleet management simpler and more efficient. Management is fully managed. What we see is container hosts, nodes in our subscription, that is where containers are running. It creates actually a VM Scale Set. I can focus on deployment yaml files.

**Serverless** - we are not paying for unit VM but just for unit of work that is being done. We have functions and we have logic apps. Functions can be executed in App Service Plan. These are event driven. There are different triggers. Functions scale automatically based on demand, so they may be a good choice when demand is variable. **Azure Functions** is an event-driven, serverless compute option that doesn’t require maintaining virtual machines or containers. Azure Functions runs your code when it's triggered and automatically deallocates resources when the function is finished. In this model, you're only charged for the CPU time used while your function runs. Functions can be either stateless or stateful. When they're stateless (the default), they behave as if they're restarted every time they respond to an event. When they're stateful (called Durable Functions), a context is passed through the function to track prior activity. **Azure Logic Apps** is a cloud platform where you can create and run automated workflows with little to no code. Example: schedule and send email notifications using Office 365 when a specific event happens, for example, a new file is uploaded. Another example is monitor tweets etc.

If you need to host your application on Azure, you might initially turn to a virtual machine (VM) or containers. There are other hosting options that you can use with Azure, including **Azure App Service**. App Service enables you to build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. It offers automatic scaling and high availability. What I pay for is the SKU. 

Networking in Azure is related to boundaries, isolation and segmentation, Internet communication, route network traffic, filter network traffic. **Azure virtual networks** and virtual subnets enable Azure resources, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, to communicate with each other, with users on the internet, and with your on-premises client computers. Azure virtual networking supports both public (can be accessed from anywhere in the world) and private endpoints (exist within a virtual network and have private IP address from address space of that virtual network) to enable communication between external or internal resources with other internal resources. We can have multiple subnets inside of virtual network. Virtual networks are IaaS type of Cloud Service.

To communicate with on-premises resources there are three mechanisms: 1. Point-to-site virtual private network 2. Site to site virtual private network 3. Azure ExpressRoute - dedicated private connectivity to Azure that doesn't travel over the internet.

Azure virtual networks enable you to filter traffic between subnets: 1. Network security groups are Azure resources that can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules. 2. Network virtual appliances are specialized VMs that can be compared to a hardened network appliance. 

A **virtual private network (VPN)** uses an encrypted tunnel within another network. VPNs are typically deployed to connect two or more trusted private networks to one another over an untrusted network (typically the public internet). A VPN gateway is a type of virtual network gateway. **Azure VPN Gateway** instances are deployed in a dedicated subnet of the virtual network. When setting up a VPN gateway, you must specify the type of VPN - either policy-based or route-based. The primary distinction between these two types is how they determine which traffic needs encryption. Policy based is static and we want to used route-based almost always.

**Azure ExpressRoute** lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection, with the help of a connectivity provider. This connection is called an ExpressRoute Circuit. With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365. This allows you to connect offices, datacenters, or other facilities to the Microsoft cloud. Each location would have its own ExpressRoute circuit. ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public Internet. This allows ExpressRoute connections to offer more reliability, faster speeds, consistent latencies, and higher security than typical connections over the Internet.

**Azure DNS** is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. Benefits: reliablity and performance, security, ease of use, alias records.

## Describe Azure storage services <a name="azure-storage-services"></a>

*Objectives*: 

- Compare Azure storage services
- Describe storage tiers
- Describe redundancy options
- Describe storage account options and storage types
- Identify options for moving files, including AzCopy, Azure Storage Explorer, and Azure File Sync
- Describe migration options, including Azure Migrate and Azure Data Box

The **Azure storage** platform is Microsoft's cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios. It offers highly available, massively scalable, durable, and secure storage for a variety of data objects in the cloud. Azure storage: durable, highly available, secure, scalable, managed, accessible. An **Azure storage accoun**t contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, and tables. The storage account provides a unique namespace for data and it is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Every object that you store in Azure Storage has a URL address that includes your unique account name. The combination of the account name and the service endpoint forms the endpoints for your storage account e.g.: *https://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net*. 

Redundancy options when creating storage account: 
- Locally redundant storage (LRS) - replicates your storage account three times within a single data center in the primary region
- Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) - replicates your storage account synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region.
- Geo-redundant storage (GRS) - GRS provides additional redundancy for data storage compared to LRS or ZRS. In addition to the three copies of data stored in one region, there are three copies stored in a paired Azure region. So GRS provides all the features of LRS storage in the primary zone, and additionally, provides a secondary LRS data storage in another region.
- Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) - combines the best of two worlds - Geo-Redundant and Zone-Redundant storage, keeping backups safe from both regional (Geo-Redundant) and Data Center (Zone-Redundant) failures.
- Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) - RA-GRS has all the same level of redundancy of standard GRS replication, with an additional benefit—the secondary copies stored in paired Azure regions are readable.
- Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS) - exposes a read endpoint on allowing you to read data in the event of primary region unavailability.

Azure Storage services: Blobs, Files, Queues, Disks, Tables.

**Azure Blobs** -  storage is an object storage solution for the cloud. It can store massive amounts of data, such as text or binary data. Azure Blob storage is unstructured, meaning that there are no restrictions on the kinds of data it can hold. Blob storage can manage thousands of simultaneous uploads, massive amounts of video data, constantly growing log files, and can be reached from anywhere with an internet connection. Use cases: serving images or documents to a browser, streaming video and audio etc. Access tiers: Hot tier (accessed or modified frequently), Cool tier (not frequently e.g.: invoices - once a month), Cold tier (infrequently accessed but requires fast retrieval), Archive tier (rarely accessed, e.g.: long-term backups).

**Azure File** - storage offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (SMB) or Network File System (NFS) protocols. Benefits: shared access, fully managed etc.

**Azure Queues** - is a service for storing large numbers of messages. Once stored, you can access the messages from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS. A queue can contain as many messages as your storage account has room for (potentially millions). Each individual message can be up to 64 KB in size. Queues are commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously. FIFO Queue.

**Azure Disks** -  or Azure managed disks, are block-level storage volumes managed by Azure for use with Azure VMs. Conceptually, they’re the same as a physical disk, but they’re virtualized – offering greater resiliency and availability than a physical disk. With managed disks, all you have to do is provision the disk, and Azure will take care of the rest.

**Azure Tables** - storage stores large amounts of structured data. Azure tables are a NoSQL datastore that accepts authenticated calls from inside and outside the Azure cloud. This enables you to use Azure tables to build your hybrid or multi-cloud solution and have your data always available. Azure tables are ideal for storing structured, non-relational data.

**Azure Migrate** - is a service that helps you migrate from an on-premises environment to the cloud. Good option when we want to copy VM or database to the cloud.

**Azure Data Box** -  is a physical migration service that helps transfer large amounts of data in a quick, inexpensive, and reliable way. The secure data transfer is accelerated by shipping you a proprietary Data Box storage device that has a maximum usable storage capacity of 80 terabytes. The Data Box is transported to and from your datacenter via a regional carrier. A rugged case protects and secures the Data Box from damage during transit. It is for offline migration. They send you disks, you copy data to it and send it back.

**Az Copy** - is a command-line utility that you can use to copy blobs or files to or from your storage account. With AzCopy, you can upload files, download files, copy files between storage accounts, and even synchronize files.

**Azure File Sync** is a tool that lets you centralize your file shares in Azure Files and keep the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of a Windows file server. You create a sync group and register the servers of the sync group. Good usage is when you want to sync some files from on premises. Azure File Sync maintains a bidirectional synchronization of files between your on-premises and cloud Windows servers.

**Azure Storage Explore**r is a standalone app that provides a graphical interface to manage files and blobs in your Azure Storage Account. It is a nice graphical tool from which we can ipload folders, files, download it etc. We can use it to interact with queues, tables. Usage: ad-hoc interactions, smaller amount of data.

**CONCEPTS AND KEYWORDS:** *Azure Storage, Azure Storage account, Storage Azure Endpoint, Azure Storage Redundancy(in primary region, in secondary region), Azure Blob, Blob access tiers, Azure File Storage, Azure Queue Storage, Azure Disk Storage, Azure Table Storage, Azure Data Migration Options: Azure Migrate, Azure Data Box, Azure File Movement Options: AzCopy, Azure Storage Explorer, Azure File Sync*

## Describe Azure identity, access, and security <a name="identity-access-security"></a>

*Objectives*: 

- Describe directory services in Azure, including Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft Entra Domain Services
- Describe authentication methods in Azure, including single sign-on (SSO), multifactor authentication (MFA), and passwordless
- Describe external identities and guest access in Azure
- Describe Microsoft Entra Conditional Access
- Describe Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Describe the concept of Zero Trust
- Describe the purpose of the defense in depth model
- Describe the purpose of Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Microsoft Entra is the name for the product family of identity and network access solutions. Microsoft Entra ID is one of the products within that family. Microsoft Entra has it's own portal.

**Microsoft Entra ID** (previously Azure Active Directory) is a directory service that enables you to sign in and access both Microsoft cloud applications and cloud applications that you develop.  Microsoft Entra ID is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service. With Microsoft Entra ID, you control the identity accounts, but Microsoft ensures that the service is available globally. Microsoft Entra ID provides: authentication, SSO, application management, device management. **Microsoft Entra Connect** synchronizes user identities between on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID contains users for organizations. Microsoft Entra ID is identity provider from Microsoft. We have services that trusts Microsoft Entra ID for authentication, e.g.: subscription will trust tenant, Office365 will trust tenant but that can be the case for third party services and applications.

**Microsoft Entra Domain Services** is a service that provides managed domain services such as domain join, group policy, lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP), and Kerberos/NTLM authentication. Just like Microsoft Entra ID lets you use directory services without having to maintain the infrastructure supporting it, with Microsoft Entra Domain Services, you get the benefit of domain services without the need to deploy, manage, and patch domain controllers (DCs) in the cloud. Microsoft Entra Domain Services integrates with your existing Microsoft Entra tenant.

**Authentication** is the process of establishing the identity of a person, service, or device. You need to prove that person or service is who they say they are. Validating identity. It requires the person, service, or device to provide some type of credential to prove who they are. Azure supports multiple authentication methods, including standard passwords, single sign-on (SSO), multifactor authentication (MFA), and passwordless. AuthN can be done with something we know (password, question), something we have (code, token. PC), something we are (fingerprint, face scan). **Authorization** comes afterwards. It's proving what we can do. In Azure authZ is always related to RBAC.

**MFA** idea of strong authentication. It is the process of prompting a user for an extra form (or factor) of identification during the sign-in process. MFA helps protect against a password compromise in situations where the password was compromised but the second factor wasn't. MFA have different forms: Auth App, SMS message, call etc. For some of these we need enhanced Azure licences. If we turn on *Security Defaults* on tenant all users get MFA but only through Auth App. Single sign-on (SSO) enables a user to sign in one time and use that credential to access multiple resources and applications from different providers. For SSO to work, the different applications and providers must trust the initial authenticator. Single sign-on is only as secure as the initial authenticator because the subsequent connections are all based on the security of the initial authenticator.

Features like MFA are a great way to secure your organization, but users often get frustrated with the additional security layer on top of having to remember their passwords. People are more likely to comply when it's easy and convenient to do so. **Passwordless authentication** methods are more convenient because the password is removed and replaced with something you have, plus something you are, or something you know. Passwordless authentication needs to be set up on a device before it can work. For example, your computer is something you have. Once it’s been registered or enrolled, Azure now knows that it’s associated with you. Now that the computer is known, once you provide something you know or are (such as a PIN or fingerprint), you can be authenticated without using a password. There are three options for passwordless authentication that integrate with Microsoft Entra ID: Windows Hello for Business (Windows PC), Microsoft Authenticator app (phone), FIDO2 security keys(USB devices, but it can be Bluetooth or NFC, hardware handles authentication).

An external identity is a person, device, service, etc. that is outside your organization.**Microsoft Entra External ID** refers to all the ways you can securely interact with users outside of your organization. With External Identities, external users can "bring their own identities." Whether they have a corporate or government-issued digital identity, or an unmanaged social identity like Google or Facebook, they can use their own credentials to sign in. The external user’s identity provider manages their identity, and you manage access to your apps with Microsoft Entra ID or Azure AD B2C to keep your resources protected.

**Conditional Access** is a tool that Microsoft Entra ID uses to allow (or deny) access to resources based on identity signals. These signals include who the user is, where the user is, and what device the user is requesting access from. Conditional access is enforced through policies. Policies have criteria. During sign-in, Conditional Access collects signals from the user, makes decisions based on those signals, and then enforces that decision by allowing or denying the access request or challenging for a multifactor authentication response.

**Azure role-based access control (RBAC)** enables you to control access. Azure provides built-in roles that describe common access rules for cloud resources. You can also define your own roles. Each role has an associated set of access permissions that relate to that role. When you assign individuals or groups to one or more roles, they receive all the associated access permissions. Role Examples: Owner, Contributor, Reader, Resource-specific, Custom. Giving certain roles to certain identities in certain scope. Inheritance: permissions assigned at a higher scope are inherited by lower scopes. Role assignment = Identity + Role + Scope. Azure RBAC is enforced on any action that's initiated against an Azure resource that passes through Azure Resource Manager. Resource Manager is a management service that provides a way to organize and secure your cloud resources. Azure RBAC doesn't enforce access permissions at the application or data level. 

Scope defines the boundaries within which the assigned role has permissions. Role-based access control is applied to a scope (management group, subscription, resource group, resource), which is a resource or set of resources that this access applies to.

**Zero Trust Model** -  is a security model that assumes the worst case scenario and protects resources with that expectation. It is based on guiding principles:
1. Verify explicitly
2. Use least privilege access
3. Assume breach

**Defense In Depth** - we want multiple layers of protection. A defense-in-depth strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advance of an attack that aims at acquiring unauthorized access to data. Layers:
1. Data - confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.
2. Application - well written, secure, best practices, don't want to put secrets in code.
3. Compute - malware, patched, firewall.
4. Network - allow only what it is required.
5. Perimeter - network perimeter. DDOS stop is done here.
6. Identity&Access - strong auth: MFA, paswordless etc.
7. Physical Security - data center itself

**Microsoft Defender for Cloud** is a monitoring tool for security posture management and threat protection. It monitors your cloud, on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments to provide guidance and notifications aimed at strengthening your security posture. Previously known as Azure Security Center. Integrates with Azure Policy. Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a multicloud security solution. Because Defender for Cloud is an Azure-native service, many Azure services are monitored and protected without needing any deployment.
