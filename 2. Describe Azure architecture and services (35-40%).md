## Describe the core architectural components of Azure <a name="core-components"></a>

*Objectives*:

 - Describe Azure regions, region pairs, and sovereign regions.
 - Describe Availability Zones.
 - Describe Azure datacenters.
 - Describe Azure resources and Resource Groups.
 - Describe subscriptions.
 - Describe management groups.
 - Describe the hierarchy of resource groups, subscriptions, and management groups.

**CONCEPTS AND KEYWORDS:** *Core architectural components: 1. Physical Infrastructure (Azure Global Infrastructure, Datacenters, Geography, Availability Zones, Regions, Region Pairs, Sovereign Regions) 2. Management Infrastructure (Azure resources, Resource Groups, Azure Resource Manager, Declarative Syntax, ARM templates, Bicep files, Subscriptions, Accounts, Management Groups), Azure Arc, ways to interact with Azure environment ...*

**Physical infrastructure**:

Physical infrastructure starts with datacenters. Datacenters are grouped into regions. **Region** is a geographical area on the plate that contains at least one datacenter that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network (2ms round trip latency envelop). We are using public cloud so we are using public regions but there are **sovereign regions** e.g.: AzureUSGovernment, China East. With these clouds data sovereignity or regulatory requirements can be met. Region pairing is the relationship between two Azure regions within the same geographic area to provide geographically redundant solutions. Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography and same regulatory boundaries (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away => **Region Pairs**. Some services have built in replication to another regions and regions are actually paired, e.g.: Azure Storage if Geo-redundant data is picked is being replicated to paired region. 

**Availability zones** are logically and physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks. Not all Azure Regions currently support availability zones. The point of availability zone is that we will get resiliency in terms of separate phsyical location/building with independent power, cooling, network. Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers and databases.

**Management infrastructure**:

Hierarchy is: Tenant -> Subscription -> Resource Group -> Resource (e.g. a VM). The **Azure AD tenant (Microsoft Entra)** provides a single place to manage users, groups and their permissions for the applications published in the Azure AD.  A tenant is an Azure Active Directory that contains users and is the basis for security. A tenant is free. Accounts that we have for Azure must live somewhere. They are living in Azure AD tenants. In tenant there are users, groups etc. Every subscription trusts one and only one Azure AD Tenant. **Azure Subscription** is base unit of an agreement between a customer and Microsoft and it is needed to use and run Azure services. Services are either license based (e.g. Azure AD P1 or M365 E5) or usage based (SQL Server, VM, or storage). License based are attached to the tenant, usage based are attached to a subscription, which is a billing vehicle. This can be an Enterprise Agreement (billed by Microsoft), Cloud Solution Provider (billed by a partner), or Pay as You Go (billed by Microsoft on a credit card). You can have any number of subscriptions on a tenant. A **resource** is the basic building block of Azure. It is a manageable item. Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource. Virtual Machines (VMs), virtual networks, databases, cognitive services, etc. are all considered resources within Azure. All resources live in resource groups. **Resource Groups** are simply groupings of resources. When resource is created you are required to place it into resource group. Single resource can be in only one resource group at a time. Resource group can't be nested. Resources are gathered into resource groups, and resource groups are gathered into subscriptions. If you have many subscriptions, you might need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. **Azure management groups** provide a level of scope above subscriptions. Ff we have multiple subscriptions, for example 4,5 subscriptions then management groups are useful. At management group we can apply RBAC, budget, policy. They are inherited down in hierarchy. Point of management groups is to help manage a group of subscriptions.
