## Describe Cloud Computing <a name="cloud-computing"></a>

*Objectives*: 

  -	Define cloud computing.
  -	Describe the shared responsibility model.
  -	Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid.
  -	Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model.
  -	Describe the consumption-based model.
  -	Compare cloud pricing models.

**CONCEPTS AND KEYWORDS:** *Cloud, Cloud computing, Microsoft Azure, Shared responsibility model (related to cloud service types), Cloud service types (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), Customer responsibilities, Cloud provider responsibilities, Cloud models (public, private, hybrid, multicloud), CapEx, OpEx...*

**The cloud** is a distributed collection of servers that host software and infrastructure, and it is accessed over the Internet. There are actual physical datacenters spread into many different locations. **Cloud computing** is the delivery of computing services over the internet. One of the cloud computing platforms is **Azure**, run by Microsoft. Essentially, cloud computing is:
1. Storage
2. Compute Power.<br>

With the **Shared responsibility model**, these responsibilities get shared between the cloud provider and the consumer. Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider. At the same time, the consumer is responsible for the data, access security and information stored in the cloud. The shared responsibility model is heavily tied into the cloud service types: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS).<br><br>
The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. The three main cloud models are: private, public, and hybrid. **Private cloud** is cloud used by a single entity. It provides greater control, privacy but it comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment.
A **public cloud** is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. A **hybrid cloud** is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment. A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources.<br><br>
**CapEx** is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. **OpEx** is spending money on services or products over time. Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. 



## Describe the benefits of using cloud services <a name="benefits-of-cloud-services"></a>

*Objectives*: 

  - Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud.
  - Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud.
  - Describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud.
  - Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud.

**CONCEPTS AND KEYWORDS:** *Azure SLAs, High Availability, Scalability (Vertical Scaling, Horizontal Scaling), Reliability, Predictability (performance and cost predictability), Elasticity, Agility, Management in the cloud, Management of the cloud, Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework*

When deploying a cloud application, two of the biggest considerations are uptime (or availability) and the ability to handle demand (scale).

**High availability** - it's important the resources are available when needed. Maximium availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur. Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the service. **Scalability** refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand. If you suddenly experience peak traffic and your systems are overwhelmed, the ability to scale means you can add more resources to better handle the increased demand. Two types of scaling: horizontal and vertical. **Reliablity** - is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. **Cloud Elasticity** can refer to 'cloud bursting' from on-premises infrastructure into the public cloud for example to meet a sudden or seasonal demand. **Cloud agility** is the ability to quickly develop, test, and launch applications in a cloud-based environment. 
 **Predictability** - can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability. Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability. Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. Support governance and compliance - set templates, auditing, automatic software patches and updates.

## Describe cloud service types <a name="cloud-service-types"></a>

*Objectives*: 

  - Describe infrastructure as a service (IaaS).
  - Describe platform as a service (PaaS).
  - Describe software as a service (SaaS).
  - Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).

**CONCEPTS AND KEYWORDS:** *Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), Software as a service (SaaS)*

**Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)** is the most flexible category of cloud services, as it provides you the maximum amount of control for your cloud resources. In an IaaS model, the cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity (to the internet), and physical security. You’re responsible for everything else: operating system installation, configuration, and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration; and so on. With IaaS, you’re essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, but what you do with that hardware is up to you. Scenarios: lift and shift migration, testing and development. Example: Azure VM, Azure page blobs.

**Platform as a service (PaaS)** is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (software as a service). In a PaaS environment, the cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet. They also maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution. In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases. Scenarios: development framework. Example: Azure SQL Database, Azure Web Apps service.

**Software as a service (SaaS)** is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. With SaaS, you’re essentially renting or using a fully developed application. Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software are all common examples of a SaaS implementation. Scenarios: Email and messaging, finance and expense tracking. Example: Office365.
